# ice-burg
An interactive art installation that connects people

### submodules note

The sound code for ice-burg was added as a git submodule. Because we're all working in different environments and programming languages, this may be a good way to 'shore up' all our code in one repository without stepping on each other's toes. See [this note](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) on git submodules to understand how they work.
